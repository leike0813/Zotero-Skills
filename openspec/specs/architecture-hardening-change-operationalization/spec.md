# architecture-hardening-change-operationalization Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change operationalize-architecture-hardening-baseline. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Baseline interpretation method SHALL be standardized
The project SHALL define a standard method for interpreting architecture hardening baseline items into executable OpenSpec changes.

#### Scenario: Stakeholder interprets an HB item
- **WHEN** a stakeholder reads an HB item from the baseline
- **THEN** they can determine scope, dependencies, and expected outputs using the standardized interpretation method

#### Scenario: Different contributors produce consistent interpretation
- **WHEN** multiple contributors decompose the same HB item
- **THEN** resulting change boundaries are consistent with the defined interpretation rules

### Requirement: HB-to-change mapping SHALL be explicit and complete
The operationalization output SHALL map every HB item (HB-01..HB-09) to concrete OpenSpec change(s), including reuse of existing changes and creation of missing ones.

#### Scenario: HB item has mapped change coverage
- **WHEN** the mapping matrix is reviewed
- **THEN** each HB item has at least one mapped change entry

#### Scenario: Existing change reuse is transparent
- **WHEN** an in-progress change is reused for HB coverage
- **THEN** the matrix records reuse status and coverage boundaries

### Requirement: Execution sequencing SHALL follow dependency-aware waves
The mapped hardening portfolio SHALL define ordered execution waves based on HB dependencies.

#### Scenario: Change execution order is reviewed
- **WHEN** implementation planning is performed
- **THEN** change order follows the declared wave/dependency model

#### Scenario: Parallelism boundaries are clear
- **WHEN** teams select concurrent work
- **THEN** they can identify which mapped changes are safe to run in parallel

### Requirement: Downstream mapped changes SHALL inherit baseline acceptance gates
Every mapped hardening change SHALL include baseline acceptance gates for behavior parity, test parity, readability delta, and traceability.

#### Scenario: Downstream change is created
- **WHEN** a new mapped change is drafted
- **THEN** its tasks or design artifacts include inherited acceptance gates

#### Scenario: Change closure review
- **WHEN** a mapped change is marked complete
- **THEN** closure review verifies gate satisfaction and HB traceability
