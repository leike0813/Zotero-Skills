## Why

As complexity grows, review speed and audit quality increasingly depend on code/test readability and clear intent documentation.  
Current readability is uneven, making cross-review and handoff costly.

## What Changes

- Define readability baseline for critical modules and test files.
- Add structured comment and naming guidance for maintainability.
- Define test intent/provenance documentation standards (especially for fixtures).
- Add reviewer checklist artifacts to support consistent audits.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `code-test-reviewability`: Defines project-level readability and reviewability standards for source code, tests, and fixtures.

### Modified Capabilities

- None.

## Impact

- Affects source/test documentation quality and review processes.
- Improves maintainability without changing runtime semantics.
- May require targeted comment and naming updates in follow-up implementation commits.
