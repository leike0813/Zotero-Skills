## 1. Risk Backlog Preparation

- [ ] 1.1 Identify and rank high-risk execution paths by impact and fragility
- [ ] 1.2 Map existing test coverage to ranked risk list
- [ ] 1.3 Define reinforcement scope for uncovered or weakly covered items

## 2. Smoke Coverage Reinforcement

- [ ] 2.1 Add smoke tests for highest-priority critical paths
- [ ] 2.2 Ensure smoke tests are stable and eligible for `lite` where applicable
- [ ] 2.3 Verify smoke cases integrate with suite membership definitions

## 3. Regression Coverage Reinforcement

- [ ] 3.1 Add targeted regression tests for fragile or escaped behaviors
- [ ] 3.2 Assign deep or heavy tests to `full` where required
- [ ] 3.3 Add traceability notes linking each test to risk rationale
